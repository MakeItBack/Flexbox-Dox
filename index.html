            <p>
               For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools
               available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and
               positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they
               are also rather limiting and frustrating.
            </p>
            <p>
               The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or
               impossible to achieve with such tools, in any kind of convenient,
               flexible way:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount
                  of the available width/height, regardless of how much
                  width/height is available.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same
                  height even if they contain a different amount of content.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of
               layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
            </p>

         <section

               <h2>Specifying what elements to lay out as flexible boxes</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
               To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid
               out as flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of
               <code class="inline-code">display</code> on the parent element of
               the elements you want to affect. In this case we want to lay out
               the <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> elements, so
               we set this on the
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;section&gt;</code>:
            </p>

            <code class="block-code"> section { display: flex; } </code>
            <p>
               This causes the
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;section&gt;</code> element to
               become a <strong>flex container</strong>, and its children to
               become <strong>flex items</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
               To be clear, let's reiterate what is happening here. The element
               we've given a <code class="inline-code">display</code> value of
               <code class="inline-code">flex</code> to is acting like a
               block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of
               the page, but its children are being laid out as flex items. The
               next section will explain in more detail what this means. Note
               also that you can use a
               <code class="inline-code">display</code> value of
               <code class="inline-code">inline-flex</code> if you wish to lay
               out an element's children as flex items, but have that element
               behave like an inline element.
            </p>

         <section id="The_flex_model" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>The flex model</h2></header>
            <p>
               When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along
               two axes:
            </p>
            <img
               src="https://developer.mozilla.org/files/3739/flex_terms.png"
            />
            <ul>
               <li>
                  The <strong>main axis</strong> is the axis running in the
                  direction the flex items are being laid out in (e.g. as rows
                  across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end
                  of this axis are called the <strong>main start</strong> and
                  <strong>main end.</strong>
               </li>
               <li>
                  The <strong>cross axis</strong> is the axis running
                  perpendicular to the direction the flex items are being laid
                  out in. The start and end of this axis are called the
                  <strong>cross start</strong> and <strong>cross end.</strong>
               </li>
               <li>
                  The parent element that has
                  <code class="inline-code">display: flex</code> set on it (the
                  <code class="inline-code">&lt;section&gt;</code> in our
                  example) is called the <strong>flex container</strong>.
               </li>
               <li>
                  The items being laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex
                  container are called <strong>flex items</strong> (the
                  <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> elements in
                  our example).
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent
               sections. You can always refer back to it if you get confused
               about any of the terms being used.
            </p>
         </section>
         <hr />

         <section id="Columns_or_rows?" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Columns or rows?</h2></header>
            <p>
               Flexbox provides a property called
               <code class="inline-code">flex-direction</code> that specifies
               what direction the main axis runs in (what direction the flexbox
               children are laid out in) — by default this is set to
               <code class="inline-code">row</code>, which causes them to be
               laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default
               language works in (left to right, in the case of an English
               browser).
            </p>
            <p>
               Try adding the following declaration to your
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code"> flex-direction: column; </code>
            <p>
               You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much
               like they were before we added any CSS. Before you move on,
               delete this declaration from your example.
            </p>
         </section>
         <hr />

         <section id="Wrapping" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Wrapping</h2></header>
            <p>
               One issue that arises when you have a fixed amount of width or
               height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children
               will overflow their container, breaking the layout. One way in
               which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to
               your <code class="inline-code">&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code"> flex-wrap: wrap; </code>
            <p>
               Also, add the following declaration to your
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code"> flex: 200px; </code>
            <p>
               We now have multiple rows — as many flexbox children are fitted
               onto each row as makes sense, and any overflow is moved down to
               the next line. The
               <code class="inline-code">flex: 200px</code> declaration set on
               the articles means that each will be at least 200px wide; we'll
               discuss this property in more detail later on. You might also
               notice that the last few children on the last row are each made
               wider so that the entire row is still filled.
            </p>
            <p>
               But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your
               <code class="inline-code">flex-direction</code> property value to
               <code class="inline-code">row-reverse</code> — now you'll see
               that you still have your multiple row layout, but it starts from
               the opposite corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.
            </p>
            <p>
               At this point it is worth noting that a shorthand exists for
               <code class="inline-code">flex-direction</code> and
               <code class="inline-code">flex-wrap</code> —
               <code class="inline-code">flex-flow</code>. So for example, you
               can replace
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
               flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap;
            </code>
            <p>with</p>
            <code class="block-code"> flex-flow: row wrap; </code>
         </section>
         <hr />

         <section id="Flexible_sizing_of_items" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Flexible sizing of items</h2></header>
            <p>
               Let's now return to our first example, and look at how we can
               control what proportion of space flex items take up compared to
               the other flex items. First, add the following rule to the bottom
               of your CSS:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code"> article { flex: 1; } </code>
            <p>
               This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much of the
               available space along the main axis each flex item will take up
               compared to other flex items. In this case, we are giving each
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> element the same
               value (a value of 1), which means they will all take up an equal
               amount of the spare space left after things like padding and
               margin have been set. It is relative to other flex items, meaning
               that giving each flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly
               the same effect.
            </p>
            <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
            <code class="block-code">
               article:nth-of-type(3) { flex: 2; }
            </code>
            <p>
               Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> takes up twice
               as much of the available width as the other two — there are now
               four proportion units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4).
               The first two flex items have one unit each so they take 1/4 of
               the available space each. The third one has two units, so it
               takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).
            </p>
            <p>
               You can also specify a minimum size value inside the flex value.
               Try updating your existing article rules like so:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
               article { flex: 1 200px; } article:nth-of-type(3) { flex: 2
               200px; }
            </code>
            <p>
               This basically states "Each flex item will first be given 200px
               of the available space. After that, the rest of the available
               space will be shared out according to the proportion units." Try
               refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared
               out. The real value of flexbox can be seen in its
               flexibility/responsiveness — if you resize the browser window, or
               add another
               <code class="inline-code">&lt;article&gt;</code> element, the
               layout continues to work just fine.

         <section id="flex:_shorthand_versus_longhand" class="main-section">

            <p>
               <code class="inline-code">flex</code> is a shorthand property
               that can specify up to three different values:
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be
                  specified individually using the
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-grow</code> longhand property.
               </li>
               <li>
                  A second unitless proportion value —
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-shrink</code> — that comes into
                  play when the flex items are overflowing their container. This
                  specifies how much of the overflowing amount is taken away
                  from each flex item's size, to stop them overflowing their
                  container. This is quite an advanced flexbox feature, and we
                  won't be covering it any further in this article.
               </li>
               <li>
                  The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be
                  specified individually using the
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-basis</code> longhand value.
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               We'd advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you
               really have to (for example, to override something previously
               set). They lead to a lot of extra code being written, and they
               can be somewhat confusing.

            <p>
               You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the
               main or cross axis.

            <ul>
               <li>
                  By default, the value is
                  <code class="inline-code">stretch</code>, which stretches all
                  flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross
                  axis. If the parent hasn't got a fixed width in the cross axis
                  direction, then all flex items will become as long as the
                  longest flex items. This is how our first example got equal
                  height columns by default.
               </li>
               <li>
                  The <code class="inline-code">center</code> value causes the
                  items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered
                  along the cross axis.
               </li>
               <li>
                  You can also have values like
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-start</code> and
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-end</code>, which will align
                  all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               You can override the
               <code class="inline-code">align-items</code> behavior for
               individual flex items by applying the
               <code class="inline-code">align-self</code> property to them.
            </p>
            <p>
               <code class="inline-code">justify-content</code> controls where
               the flex items sit on the main axis.
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  The default value is
                  <code class="inline-code">flex-start</code>, which makes all
                  the items sit at the start of the main axis.
               </li>
               <li>
                  You can use <code class="inline-code">flex-end</code> to make
                  them sit at the end.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <code class="inline-code">center</code> is also a value for
                  <code class="inline-code">justify-content</code>, and will
                  make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <code class="inline-code">space-around</code> is useful — it
                  distributes all the items evenly along the main axis, with a
                  bit of space left at either end.
               </li>
               <li>
                  There is another value,
                  <code class="inline-code">space-between</code>, which is very
                  similar to
                  <code class="inline-code">space-around</code> except that it
                  doesn't leave any space at either end.
               </li>
            </ul>
